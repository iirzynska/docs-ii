== Deploying the {amx-rhoai-mcg-pattern}

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console] and select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`.
* The cluster must have worker nodes with Intel AMX feature enabled, so the *5th Generation of Intel Xeon Processors* is highly recommended
 ** link:../../multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai/mcg-amx-rhoai-cluster-sizing[Cluster sizing] requirements.
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/amx-accelerated-rhoai-multicloud-gitops/[amx-accelerated-rhoai-multicloud-gitops] repository on GitHub.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/amx-accelerated-rhoai-multicloud-gitops.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials for the config-demo application and edit it if you want to customize the secret. If not, the framework generates a random password.
+
[source,terminal]
----
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
====

. (Optional) You may customize the deployment for your cluster depending on your needs by editing values-global.yaml and values-hub.yaml. To do this run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
git checkout -b my-branch
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git add values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git commit values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git push origin my-branch
----

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator] - both methods are described below.

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
=== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the `kubeconfig` file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
./pattern.sh make install
----

Verify that the Operators have been installed.

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes* 
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *Validated Patterns Operator*
* *OpenVINO Toolkit Operator*
* *Red Hat Openshift AI*

+


=== Deploying the cluster by using the Validated Patterns Operator

To install the *Validated Patterns Operator*:

. Log in to the *Openshift Container Platform* web console and select *Operators > OperatorHub*.

. Search for *Validated Patterns Operator*, open it and click *Install*.

+
.Install Validated Patterns Operator step 1
image::multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai/amx-rhoai-validated-pattern-operator-1.png[Install Validated Patterns Operator,scale=50]
+

. Choose default settings for the installation mode, namespaces and update strategy and confirm it by clicking *Install*.

+
.Install Validated Patterns Operator step 2
image::multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai/amx-rhoai-validated-pattern-operator-2.png[Install Validated Patterns Operator,scale=50]
+

. Select *Operators > Installed Operators*.

. Ensure that *Validated Patterns Operator* is listed in the `openshift-operators` project with a status `Succeeded`.

== Create {amx-rhoai-mcg-pattern}

After a successful installation, open *Validated Patterns Operator* page. Next, go to *Pattern* tab and click *Create Pattern*.

. Set the *Name* field to `multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai` and *Cluster Group Name* to `hub`, Values must be the same as in the _values-global.yaml_ file (Figure 3).

. As a *Git Config > Target Repo* value, paste the link to your fork. Under *Git Config > Target Revision* write the name of your branch (Figure 3).

. Click *Create* button to create the pattern.
+

+


Verify that the rest of Operators have been installed:

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes*
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *OpenVINO Toolkit Operator*
* *Red Hat Openshift AI*

== Verification

Go to the Hub ArgoCD and verify that all applications are synchronized. The URL can be found in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for the project `multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai-hub` or use command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc -n multicloud-gitops-amx-rhoai-hub get route hub-gitops-server -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

All applications should be `Healthy` and `Synced`:

As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].

== Start your workload

Now, you are ready to use installed pattern. 

* Test basic application deployment and setup with link:../mcg-amx-rhoai-demo-script/[*Hello World Demo*]. 

* Jump straight to AI workload example with link:../mcg-amx-rhoai-bert-script/[*Intel AMX Demo*].

[id="next-steps_mcg-getting-started"]
== Next steps

After the management hub is set up and works correctly, attach one or more managed clusters to the architecture.

For instructions on deploying the edge, refer to link:../mcg-amx-rhoai-managed-cluster/[Attach a managed cluster (edge) to the management hub].
